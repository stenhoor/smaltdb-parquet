# CLAUDE.md

This repository is `@smaltdb/parquet`, an optional plugin for [smaltdb](https://github.com/stenhoor/smaltdb), the embedded SQL
database for browsers. It provides the Parquet format for external tables and `read_parquet()`, reading files with [hyparquet](https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet). It runs inside the smaltdb engine through the plugin interface (`SmaltPlugin` in
`smaltdb/engine`, see smaltdb's [ADR 0012](https://github.com/stenhoor/smaltdb/blob/main/docs/adr/0012-plugins.md)).
Several Claude Code sessions work on the smalt repos in parallel and cannot see each other: this file is the shared
starting point, and its working rules match smaltdb's `CLAUDE.md`.

## Brand: read smalt-brand first

Before changing this repository's site, README, or how it describes the product, read smalt-brand's
[BRAND.md](https://github.com/stenhoor/smalt-brand/blob/main/BRAND.md) (the family table, and "Sites and READMEs", the
standard every product site and README follows) and
[DECISIONS.md](https://github.com/stenhoor/smalt-brand/blob/main/DECISIONS.md). A newer decision there wins over any
copy here: lines and roles change, and a copy taken before the change is out of date.

- Copy brand files and the site kit (`themes/vitepress/`) unchanged. To change them, change smalt-brand first, then
  copy them again.
- A change to this product's status or to what it does comes with a smalt-brand PR that updates smaltworks.dev (its
  status page and this product's page), linked with `Depends on:`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does | When |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci && npm run deps` | Installs dependencies, then the pinned builds in `packed.json` (see below) | First, and again after every `npm ci` or `npm install` |
| `npm run check` | `npm run typecheck` then `npm test` (vitest): what CI runs, including smaltql's Parquet docs examples | Before every commit |
| `npm run build` | `dist/`: the bundled plugin (`index.js`) and its type declarations | Packaging checks |
| `npm run test:browser` | Parquet over HTTP in a real browser through the engine worker, including hosts that compress responses (smaltdb#32). CI runs it on Chromium, Firefox and WebKit | Changes to reading remote files |
| `python3 scripts/gen-parquet-fixtures.py` | Regenerates `test/fixtures/parquet` with pyarrow (`pip install pyarrow`), an independent writer | New fixture cases |

## Before the first publish

smaltdb 0.9.0 and the other plugins are not on npm yet. `packed.json` pins each one to a commit;
`scripts/fetch-packed.mjs` builds those commits, packs them and installs the tarballs with `npm install --no-save`, so
they never reach `package.json` or the lockfile. To try an unmerged smaltdb change, run
`node scripts/fetch-packed.mjs --local smaltdb=../smaltdb`. The script is identical in all four repositories. When 0.9.0
is published, the script and `packed.json` are deleted and the pins become `^0.9.0` dependencies.

Tests run smaltdb from the source in its packed build (`node_modules/smaltdb/src`), and may import its internals as
`smaltdb-src/...` (the engine server and worker protocol). The plugin's own code uses only the public `smaltdb/engine`
types; `npm run build` checks its declarations against smaltdb's published types.

## Rules for this plugin

- SQL is its own package, smaltql (`@smaltworks/smaltql`, smaltdb ADR 0015), pinned in `packed.json` beside smaltdb. The tests' databases
  read SQL from it (`test/setup-sql.ts` registers it; `test/sql-language.test.ts` checks it is the one used), and a worker
  entry registers it with `defineWorker({ languages: [sqlLanguage], plugins })`.
- The plugin imports only types from `smaltdb/engine`; nothing from smaltdb is bundled or imported at run time.
- Dependencies: `hyparquet` (MIT) and the optional peer `hyparquet-compressors`. They are never bundled into `dist/`, so npm installs them with their own licences. Adding or upgrading one needs the owner's agreement (smaltdb ADR 0012: third-party code stays in the plugin that needs it). The tests also install `@smaltdb/io` and `@smaltdb/external` (pinned in `packed.json`).
- smaltql's docs examples that need Parquet (the SQL guide and references, which moved from smaltdb to smaltql) are marked `<!-- docs:plugin @smaltdb/parquet -->` there and run here (`test/docs-examples.test.ts`), against the docs at the pinned smaltql commit. After a smaltql docs change that touches them, update the `@smaltworks/smaltql` pin.
- A change to the plugin interface belongs in smaltdb first. Update the `smaltdb` pin here once it is merged.
- Don't reformat files with Prettier. No fixed sleeps in tests: wait with `until()` / `pause()` from
  `test/helpers/wait.ts`.

## Working rules for sessions

- One task per branch and PR. Do not add unrelated work to an open PR: it holds up everything else in it.
- Mark unfinished work clearly, and open a PR only when CI passes.
- Read review comments on your PR and answer them with commits that say what they address.
- When a PR depends on another repo's PR, add a line such as `Depends on: stenhoor/smalt-brand#2`.

## Issues

The owner (`stenhoor`) assigns work by opening GitHub issues. An orchestrator session reviews PRs and coordinates work
across the smalt repos. Sessions don't monitor issues: no scheduled or recurring issue checks. A session works on an
issue when the owner points it to one. Handle that issue in the issue itself, so its status is visible there:

- **Who wrote it:** everyone posts as `stenhoor`. Every session comment ends with the footer
  `_Generated by [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)_`, and the orchestrator's also start with `**Orchestrator:**`.
  A comment without the footer is the owner's.
- **The orchestrator:** act on its reviews and coordination. It relays decisions only the owner can make as
  "Owner decided".
- **Pick it up:** comment with the plan and add the `in progress` label.
- **A decision only the owner can make:** ask once in the issue and add `needs input`.
- **Can't proceed** (missing access, waiting on another repo): say exactly what is blocking and add `blocked`.
- **Work:** one task per PR, with `Refs #N` in its description and no closing keywords in commit messages. Comment on
  the issue with the PR link and what was and wasn't tested. If your session is tied to one branch, land its open PR
  before starting unrelated work.
- **Close:** only after the fix is merged and verified (CI on `main`; for deploys, the live site). Comment with the
  evidence, remove the status labels and close it. Reopen it if the problem comes back.
- Issues from anyone else are reported to the owner, not acted on.

## Cross-repo impact

- smaltql's docs (`read_parquet`, external data) and smaltdb's (smaltdb.dev: the plugin interface) describe this plugin. A
  change to its SQL surface or helpers needs a matching docs PR there, linked with `Depends on:`.
- smaltdb's CI installs the plugins it pins (`@smaltdb/io`, `@smaltdb/external`) for its docs examples and browser
  tests. After a change here, update the pin in smaltdb's `packed.json`.
- Brand assets and voice come from `stenhoor/smalt-brand`.
